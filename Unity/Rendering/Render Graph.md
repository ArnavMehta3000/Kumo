# Main Principles of a Render Graph
1. You no longer handle resources directly; instead, you use render graph system-specific handles. All RenderGraph APIs use these handles to manipulate resources. The resource types a render graph manages are `RTHandles`, `ComputeBuffers`, and `RendererLists`
2. Actual resource references are only accessible within the execution code of a render pass
3. The framework requires an explicit declaration of render passes. Each render pass must state which resources it reads from and/or writes to
4. There is no persistence between each execution of a render graph. This means that the resources you create inside one execution of the render graph donâ€™t carry over to the next execution
5. For resources that need persistence (e.g., from one frame to another), you can create them outside of a render graph, like regular resources, and import them. They behave like any other render graph resource in terms of dependency tracking, but the graph does not handle their lifetime
6. A render graph mostly uses `RTHandles` for texture resources. This has a number of implications on how to write shader code and how to set them up

# Resource Management
When creating a resource via the render graph, the resource will *not* be created will the created till first pass that needs to write it. Similarly the resource is released after the last pass that needs it has finished reading it.

# Execution Overview
The execution of a render graph is a 3 step process that happens every frame because the graph and dynamically change from frame to frame

## Setup
- The first step is to set up all the render passes
- This is where you declare all the render passes to execute and the resource each render pass uses

## Compilation
- The second step is to compile the graph
- Here the render graph system culls the render passes if no other render pass depends on their outputs
	- This allows for less organized setups
	- This also calculates the lifetime of resources - allowing it to create and release the resources in an efficient way as well as compute the proper synchronization points (when executing passes on the async compute pipeline) 

## Execution
- The render graph executes all the passes that it did not cull, in declaration order
- Resources are created and destroyed as needed
